# DCC-GJR-GARCH

This project showcases an advanced GARCH implementation in Python. It determines parameters defining the volatility of each stock's returns, the correlations between them, and then plugs this volatility model into a Monte Carlo simulation to model stock prices with leveraged, correlated volatility clustering.
