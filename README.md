# GJR-GARCH(1,1)

This project showcases an advanced GARCH implementation in Python, GJR-GARCH(1,1). It pulls a stock's price data from Yahoo Finance, determines the GARCH model parameters best defining the stock's returns variance, and then uses this model in a Monte Carlo simulation to simulate future stock prices with asymmetric volatility clustering.
