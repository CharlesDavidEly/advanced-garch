# GJR-GARCH(1,1)

This project showcases an advanced GARCH implementation in Python, GJR-GARCH(1,1). It pulls a stock's data from Yahoo Finance, determines the parameters best defining the variance of its returns, and then plugs this variance model into a Monte Carlo simulation to model future stock prices with asymmetric volatility clustering.
