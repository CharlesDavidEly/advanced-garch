# Advanced GARCH

This project showcases an advanced GARCH implementation in Python, GJR-GARCH(1,1). It pulls a stock's price data, determines the parameters best defining the stock's returns variance, and then uses this in a Monte Carlo simulation to simulate stock prices with asymmetric volatility clustering.
